# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: visual-asset-hub 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: Based on the information provided, I'll analyze the Visual Content Management System (VCMS) application and provide a concise description to aid in building the database schema and application structure. Since some details are not specified, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on common practices for content management systems.
Application Analysis
Purpose: The Visual Content Management System (VCMS) is designed to help users organize, manage, and distribute visual content such as images, videos, and other multimedia files.
Target Users: Content creators, marketers, designers, and organizations that need to manage and distribute visual assets efficiently.
Key Features:
User authentication and authorization
Content upload and storage
Content categorization and tagging
Search and filtering capabilities
Version control and revision history
Content sharing and distribution
User roles and permissions management
Analytics and reporting
User Flow Description
Core User Actions:
User registration and login
Content upload and management
Content organization (categorization, tagging)
Content search and retrieval
Content sharing and distribution
User and permission management
Data Input and Submission:
Users upload visual content (images, videos) through a web interface
Users input metadata for content (title, description, tags, categories)
Administrators create and manage user accounts and permissions
Data Retrieval and Display:
Users browse and search for content using filters and search functionality
Content is displayed in galleries or list views with thumbnails and metadata
Detailed view of individual content items with full metadata and version history
User Interaction and Navigation:
Dashboard for quick access to recent content and system overview
Navigation menu for accessing different sections (upload, search, manage, analytics)
User profile and settings management
Database Schema Considerations
Entities:
Users
Content Items
Categories
Tags
Permissions
Versions
Relationships:
Users have many Content Items (one-to-many)
Content Items belong to many Categories (many-to-many)
Content Items have many Tags (many-to-many)
Users have many Permissions (many-to-many)
Content Items have many Versions (one-to-many)
Attributes:
Users: id, username, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at
Content Items: id, title, description, file_path, file_type, file_size, created_by, created_at, updated_at
Categories: id, name, description, parent_category_id
Tags: id, name
Permissions: id, name, description
Versions: id, content_item_id, version_number, file_path, created_by, created_at
Normalized Schema:
Implement junction tables for many-to-many relationships (e.g., content_categories, content_tags, user_permissions)
Use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity
Summary
The Visual Content Management System (VCMS) is a web application designed to help users manage and distribute visual content efficiently. Key features include content upload, organization, search, and sharing capabilities, along with user management and analytics.
The main user flows involve content upload, management, and retrieval, with a focus on efficient organization and easy access to visual assets. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and managing content, as well as robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
The database schema should include entities for Users, Content Items, Categories, Tags, Permissions, and Versions, with appropriate relationships and attributes to support the application's functionality. The schema should be normalized to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.
Recommendations for the application structure include:
Implement a modular architecture to separate concerns (e.g., authentication, content management, search)
Use a robust file storage system to handle large visual assets efficiently
Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance for frequently accessed content
Ensure proper security measures, including input validation, secure file uploads, and protection against common web vulnerabilities
Design the system with scalability in mind, considering potential future growth in users and content volume 

## Who is the owner of this repository?
By default, GPT Engineer projects are created with public GitHub repositories.

However, you can easily transfer the repository to your own GitHub account by navigating to your [GPT Engineer project](https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve) and selecting Settings -> GitHub. 

## How can I edit this code?
There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use GPT Engineer**

Simply visit the GPT Engineer project at [GPT Engineer](https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve) and start prompting.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
